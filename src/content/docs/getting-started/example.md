SesUI collects commonly used web components built with Tailwind CSS, designed to be compatible with universal frontend tools such as plain HTML, Vue, and React.

SesUI is **not** a component library—you don’t need to install any packages to use the components provided here. Simply copy the code and paste it into your project. [Read the full usage guide here](/).

All components are custom-built by us, with some inspired by existing UI designs.

Each component is initially built in plain HTML, then adapted for Vue and React to ensure easy integration with modern frontend frameworks.
