**Gurun Kit** is a collection of Vue components designed with Tailwind CSS.

**Gurun Kit** is not a library or a package—you don’t need to install anything. All you have to do is copy the component code and paste it into your project. [Read the full usage guide here](/getting-started/usage-guide).

The component designs in **Gurun Kit** are originally built by us, although we take a lot of inspiration from existing UI designs.
