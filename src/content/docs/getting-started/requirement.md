description: Requirement to use SesUI
---

To use **SesUI**, you need to have **Vue 3** and install **Tailwind CSS** with a minimum version of **v3**.

Some components may require additional packages or libraries. For example, the **Modal component** depends on external libraries to handle transitions, animations, or click-outside detection.
