description: Requirement to use SesUI
---

To use **SesUI**, you only need to install **Tailwind CSS**, with a minimum version of **v3**.

Some components may require additional packages or libraries. For example, the **Modal component for Vue** depends on external libraries to handle transitions, animations, or click-outside detection.
