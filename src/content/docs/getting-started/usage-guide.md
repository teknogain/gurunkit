## Install Tailwind CSS

First, make sure Tailwind CSS is installed in your project. If you havenâ€™t installed it yet, you can read the [installation guide here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

## Choose a Component

Browse and select the component you want to use in your project.

## Select the Framework Version

Pick the version of the component based on your project type: plain HTML, Vue, or React.

## Copy and Paste

Copy the component code and paste it into your project.

## Organize for Vue or React

For Vue and React, it's recommended to create a separate file for the component. Then, import and use the component wherever you need it.

## Advanced Usage

Check the **Advanced Usage** section (usually found at the bottom of the component page) to learn how to use props, model binding, and other features for Vue and React.
