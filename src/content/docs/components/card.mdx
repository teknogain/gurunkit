The `Card` component is a simple container with padding and border styling, used to group related content in a clean and structured layout.

## Base Component

This is the basic implementation of the card component:

```vue
<template>
  <div class="rounded-md border border-gray-300 p-4">
    <slot />
  </div>
</template>
````

## Usage

You can use the `Card` component by importing and wrapping your content with it.

### Plain Card

```vue
<script setup>
import BaseCard from './components/base/base-card.vue'
</script>

<template>
  <base-card>
    Card Content
  </base-card>
</template>
```

This will render a box with rounded corners, a light border, and padding around the content inside.
